## Objectives

* Deliver a fully functional Connect 4 game with accurate rules and win detection.
* Provide a professional, user-friendly interface.
* Apply good programming practices and modular design.
* Enable easy extension (AI player, animations, score tracking).

---

## Core Features

* Two-player gameplay (Red vs. Yellow).
* Interactive grid with column-based disc placement.
* Real-time win detection (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
* Draw detection when the board is full.
* Game reset and replay functionality.
