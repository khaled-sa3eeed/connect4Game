Connect 4 is a classic two-player strategy game played on a vertical grid made up of 7 columns and 6 rows. Players take turns dropping a colored disc into one of the columns. The disc falls straight down and occupies the lowest available space in that column.

The goal of the game is to be the first player to connect four of their discs in a row. The connection can be made horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Players must think strategically, both to create their own winning combinations and to block their opponent’s moves.

The game ends when one player successfully connects four discs or when the grid is completely filled, resulting in a draw. Connect 4 combines simple rules with strategic depth, making it suitable for players of all ages.
